//MOCK_PROJECTS is an array of objects, each object is a project. We're going to display the projects in a list and so we need to stringify the array of objects to display it in the browser. The second argument is a replacer function so we can pass null because we don't need to replace anything. The third argument is the number of spaces to use for indentation. We're going to use 2 spaces for indentation.
